            <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
            <P>
                arbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients essential for human nutrition, alongside proteins and fats. They serve as the primary source of energy for the body,
                providing fuel for various bodily functions, including physical activity and cognitive processes. Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms,
                typically arranged in a ratio of 1:2:1. They exist in various forms, including simple sugars like glucose and fructose found in fruits,
                and complex carbohydrates such as starches found in grains and some vegetables. While they are crucial for energy production,
                not all carbohydrates are created equal; some are more nutrient-dense and provide additional benefits like fiber, however, excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates,
                such as those found in sugary snacks and beverages, can lead to health issues like obesity and diabetes.
                Thus, it's important to consume carbohydrates in moderation and focus on sources that offer nutritional value.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h2>Starch</h2>
            <p>
                Starch is a complex carbohydrate consisting of long chains of glucose molecules, making it a significant source of energy for humans.
                It serves as a storage form of energy in plants, predominantly found in foods like grains (such as wheat, rice, and oats),
                pulses (like beans and lentils), and tubers (such as potatoes). Starch plays a vital role in the human diet,
                providing a steady release of energy over time due to its slow digestion. This gradual breakdown helps maintain stable blood
                sugar levels and sustained energy throughout the day. Additionally, starch-rich foods often contain essential nutrients such as vitamins,
                minerals, and dietary fiber, contributing to overall health and well-being. Incorporating a variety of starch sources into the diet ensures
                a balanced intake of carbohydrates and other nutrients necessary for optimal functioning of the body. In summary, starch is your main source of 
                slow release energy throughout the day.
            </p>

            <h2>Sugar</h2>
            <p>
                Sugar refers to a type of simple carbohydrate found naturally in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy products,
                as well as added to numerous processed foods and beverages during manufacturing. The most common type of sugar is sucrose,
                which is extracted from sugarcane and widely used as a sweetener in cooking and baking. Other types of sugars include fructose,
                found in fruits and honey, and lactose, present in milk and dairy products. While sugars in whole foods come packaged with essential nutrients
                like vitamins, minerals, and fiber, added sugars in processed foods offer little to no nutritional value. Excessive consumption of added
                sugars has been linked to various health issues, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cavities. Therefore, it's important
                to be mindful of sugar intake and try to opt for home made snacks rather than convenience foods, and try more health focused snacks such as carrot sticks
                and hummus. Finally, its important to read the nutritional information on the packaging to know just how much sugar is in the products you consume.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Fibre</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot digest or absorb. rather
                it passes relatively intact through the digestive system, aiding in digestion and promoting bowel regularity.
                Think of it as a hand pushing things alone to ensure nothing sits still for longer than it needs to.
                Dietary fiber comes from plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Generally, most fibre can be found in the germ of a grain.
                Consuming an adequate amount of fiber is essential for maintaining overall digestive health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart
                disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer and constapation. Incorporating a variety of fiber-rich foods into the diet such as "brown" foods (brown bread, brown rice)
                ensures a well-rounded intake of nutrients and that nothing is hindered when being digested.
