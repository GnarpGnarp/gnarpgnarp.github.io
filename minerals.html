            <h2>Minerals</h2>
            <P>
                Minerals are essential nutrients required by the human body to support various physiological functions.
                These inorganic elements play crucial roles in processes such as bone formation, enzyme activity, fluid balance,
                and nerve function. Each mineral serves specific functions; for instance, calcium is vital for bone health, iron is necessary for oxygen transport,
                and potassium helps regulate blood pressure. A balanced diet rich in a variety of nutrient-dense foods ensures an adequate
                intake of these essential minerals, promoting overall health and well-being.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h2>Iron</h2>
            <p>
                Iron is a crucial mineral essential for various physiological functions within the human body. One of its primary roles is in the formation of hemoglobin,
                the protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body.
                Additionally, iron is involved in energy metabolism and the production of certain hormones.
                Adequate iron intake is particularly important for preventing iron deficiency anemia, a condition characterized by fatigue,
                weakness, and impaired cognitive function. Good dietary sources of iron include lean meats, poultry, fish, pulses,
                fortified foods and leafy green vegetables. While iron is abundant in many foods, certain factors such as poor absorption or increased demand
                (such as during pregnancy or menstruation) may necessitate supplementation or targeted dietary adjustments to maintain optimal iron
                levels and support overall health.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Potassium</h2>
            <p>
                Potassium is a vital mineral essential for maintaining proper fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction within the human body.
                It plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure by counteracting the effects of sodium and helping to relax blood vessel walls.
                Potassium also supports heart health by contributing to the rhythmic contractions of the heart muscle. Adequate potassium intake is associated
                with a reduced risk of stroke, kidney stones, and osteoporosis. Good dietary sources of potassium include bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes,
                spinach, avocados, and beans. However, despite its importance, many people do not consume enough potassium-rich foods, often due to a diet
                high in processed foods and low in fruits and vegetables. Increasing the intake of potassium-rich foods can help support overall health and
                well-being, especially when combined with a balanced diet and lifestyle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Calcium</h2>
            <p>
                Calcium is an essential mineral crucial for maintaining strong bones and teeth, as well as supporting various physiological processes within the human
                body. It plays a pivotal role in bone formation and density, helping to prevent osteoporosis and reduce the risk of fractures, particularly as
                individuals age. Beyond skeletal health, calcium is involved in muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Adequate calcium intake
                is particularly important during childhood and adolescence when bones are still developing, as well as during pregnancy and lactation. Good dietary
                sources of calcium include dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, as well as leafy green vegetables like kale and broccoli, fortified
                plant-based milk alternatives, and certain fish with edible bones like canned fish. Ensuring an adequate intake of calcium through
                a balanced diet or supplementation, when necessary, is vital for promoting overall health and longevity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Iodine</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                Iodine is a trace mineral essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which play a crucial role in regulating metabolism,
                growth, and development within the human body. The thyroid gland relies on iodine to produce thyroxine that help control energy production
                and utilization in cells. If you do not get enough thyroxine you may develop goitre.
