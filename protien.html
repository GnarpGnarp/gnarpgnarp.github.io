           <h2>Protien</h2>
           <P>
            Proteins are essential molecules made up of smaller units called amino acids. They play crucial roles in our bodies,
            from building and repairing tissues to regulating processes like metabolism and immune response.
            Found in a variety of foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and plant-based sources like beans and nuts,
            proteins are vital for maintaining our health and supporting various bodily functions.
           </P>
           <br>
           <h2>Amiino Acids</h2>
           <p>Amiino Acids are small chains of molecules that are the makeup of protien, there are 20 different amiino acids although they all share
            the same basic structure, this structure being made of Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen, Oxygen only being found in the carboxyl group of amiino acid.
            Among these 20 there is a group called "essential amiino acids" this is a group of 8 which are given such reverence as they cannot be produced within the human
            body and therefore must be taken in through the diet. The namees of these is as follows:
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Isoleucine</li>
                <li>Leucine</li>
                <li>Lysine</li>
                <li>Methionine</li>
                <li>Phenylalanine</li>
                <li>Threonine</li>
                <li>Tryptophan</li>
                <li>Valine</li>
            </ol>
           </p>
           <br>
           <h2>Lipoproteins</h2>
           <p>A lipoprotein is a complex molecule made up of fats (lipids) and proteins.
             These molecules play a vital role in transporting fats through the bloodstream. The structure of lipoproteins allows them to carry fats, such as cholesterol.
             They come in two varieties, High Density Lipoproteins and Low Density Lipoproteins. High Lipoproteins are used to carry fats around the body, but they are not made equal.
             Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) are often refered to as "bad" lipoproteins due when there are too many LDLs they will begin to line the walls of arteries, restricting the 
             blood flow through them. This can  lead to heart disease if it gets too bad. High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) are often refered to as the "good" lipoproteins, this is because
             as in opposition to the LDLs, they help remove excess cholesterol from the blood stream.
